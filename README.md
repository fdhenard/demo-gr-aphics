Demographic record processing with [files](#file-processing) and a [web API](#web-api-processing).

## Record Formatting

A single record with pipe `' | '` delimited formatting:

`LastName | FirstName | Gender | FavoriteColor | DateOfBirth`

eg.

`Smith | Jim | M | Blue | 1955-11-03`

comma `', '` and space `' '` are the other [delimiter options](#delimiter-options)

### Field formats and options

- Gender options - `m`, `male`, `f`, `female`, `M`, `MALE`, `F`, `FEMALE`, `Male`, `Female`
- FavoriteColor options - `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `indigo`, `violet`
- DateOfBirth - `YYYY-MM-DD`

## File Processing

Process a file of demographic data lines, and output them in various sort orders.

The input file should be a list of the records with the format as indicated in [Record Formatting](#record-formatting).  Each record should be separated with return (newline) characters.  If there are any formatting errors, the record will be ignored, but a description of the error will be shown as part of the output.  After the line errors, the program will display the records in three different sort orders:

1. sorted by gender (females before males) then by last name ascending.
2. sorted by birthdate, ascending
3. sorted by last name, descending


### File Processing Usage

`$ lein run <filepath> <delimiter>`

#### Delimiter options

- pipe - `' | '`
- comma - `', '`
- space - `' '`

## Web API Processing

`POST` data lines to the web server will add the records to memory storage.  `GET` request methods to the various endpoints can get the records in their corresponding sorting orders.  More info below.

### Web API Usage

#### Run the web server

Run webserver: `$ lein run webserver`

Webserver Options:

`-p`, `--port PORT`  Port Number (Default is 3000)

#### Web API Endpoints

webserver can be accessed via `http://localhost:<port>`

- `POST` request method to `/records` - Post a single [data line](#record-formatting) in any of the [three delimiter options](#delimiter-options).
    - Add a header named `Delimiter` with the value of either `pipe`, `comma`, or `space` (see [Delimiter Options](#delimiter-options))
- `GET` request method to `/records/gender` to get the records in gender order in JSON formatting
- `GET` request method to `/records/birthdate` - same as above sorted by Birthdate
- `GET` request method to `/records/name` - same as above sorted by LastName, then FirstName
  
## Assumptions

- user has leiningen
- only one input file per run
- all records from the file can fit into available memory
- delimiter types are described in cli run usage, or header on web
- any records with problems will be rejected
- input date must coerce to `java-time/local-date` - recommend `YYYY-MM-DD`
- webserver
    - no security concerns - not SSL, no authentication
